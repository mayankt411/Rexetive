Rexetive is an AI-powered platform that leverages blockchain technology to create a secure, decentralized system for validating and sharing knowledge. At its core, the platform integrates OpenAIâ€™s large language models (LLMs) to evaluate and verify user-submitted insights. Once validated, these insights are tokenized as NFTs using smart contracts written in Sui Move, ensuring each piece of knowledge is tamper-proof and uniquely traceable on the blockchain. This combination of AI verification and NFT-based minting enables trusted, immutable knowledge sharing without centralized oversight. The system is built as a full-stack application using FastAPI for the backend and React.js with Vite for a fast and interactive frontend experience. It communicates seamlessly with both the OpenAI API for natural language processing and the Sui blockchain for smart contract execution, using sqlite3 as a lightweight database to manage local data. Together, these components create a streamlined pipeline from user input to blockchain-verified, AI-approved knowledge distribution.
